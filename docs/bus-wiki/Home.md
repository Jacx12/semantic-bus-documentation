Welcome to the Semantic-Bus wiki!

The semantic bus can be assimilated to a "[Rosetta stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)" for data.

It is able to work with data of varied technical formats (storage / exposure), but also to translate a source semantics in a target semantics.

The semantic bus is an hybrid between an Enterprise Bus (ESB) and an Extract Transform Load (ETL), all in the cloud.

The aim is to provide organizations an ergonomic, modular, and powerful open-source tool capable of ensuring interoperability between several heterogeneous systems, technically as semantically.
